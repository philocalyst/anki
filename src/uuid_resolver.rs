//! This file defines the resolution algorithim, which, given a commit object,
//! traces its history up to the present commit on the present branch, all the
//! while comparing iterations of the object over time in an attempt to preserve
//! the identifers made at each notes first declaration, enabling stable
//! representations through deletions, reorders, additions, and modifications
//! within data models that need to track state (Like Anki); Provided that the
//! user doesn't attempt more than one change operation at a time (Following
//! typical Git commit standards)
